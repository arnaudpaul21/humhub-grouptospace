# Group to Space

This Humhub module permits once activated to add user groups to a space easily.

To install:

- Place `grouptospace folder into your `protected/modules` directory.
- To override default space invite button, move the `inviteButton.php` file into your theme at `mytheme/views/space/widgets/` directory.
- Activate the plugin on your admin interface.

You will find an additional tab into Space Invite modal containing a selector with groups list. 
Note that only app admins can use it, for security reasons.
